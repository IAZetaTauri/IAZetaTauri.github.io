                <h3>Genre</h3>
                <p>Hip&ndash;Hop, R&B, Pop</p>
                <h3>Length</h3>
                <p>23 Minutes</p>
                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>
                    Mixing old school Hip&ndash;hop with modern R&B and Pop, STRAYE's producer unit wanted to bring a 
                    fresh but familiar sound with this album. A fun play on this concept, STRAYE members decided on the 
                    name RE&ndash;play for their 3rd Full Length Album. STRAYE also helped to design the cover of the album,
                    using nostalgic elements such as cassettes, pixel text, and vintage stickers. The album also features unreleased mix&ndash;tapes created by 
                    sub&ndash;units in the group, which were made pre&ndash;debut. This gives more meaning to the name RE&ndash;play, giving
                    the members a chance to re&ndash;live past memories with their fans.

            <h3>2nd Full Length Album</h3>
            <h2>Para:digm &mdash; Sector 1 : MOVEMENT</h2>

                <h3>Genre</h3>
                <p>Indie Rock, Alternative Rock, Hard Rock</p>
                <h3>Length</h3>
                <p>32 Minutes</p>
                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>
                    Para:digm wanted to produce a heavy and rebellious sound with this album, utilizing heavy guitar riffs
                    and booming vocals to get their point across. It's the very idea of rebellion that gave inspiration for the name
                    of their 2nd Album, Sector 1 : MOVEMENT. The album cover was designed by one of Para:digm's own: San. He created the 
                    design with input from the members, describing the cover as follows, "The red represents the aggression we can feel when we're stimulated to act, while the spray paint font 
                    gives an impression of graffiti art, which is often used to spread political and social messages. I wanted to portray 
                    the sound of the album visually, before a listener even heard a single song". San mentioned he decided to add the 
                    phrase "On Air" to represent the broadcasting of their message.
